# pdf-form-service

<p>
This is a microservice prototype based on a clients requirements. Its characteristics are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate custom pdfs forms with fillable fields</li>
<li>Works on aws lambda functions</li>
<li>Implements github actions CI pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>As aws lambda functions do not suport PHP natively, it uses a very neat setup with 'Bref', which uses aws cloudformation to create the environment</p>
